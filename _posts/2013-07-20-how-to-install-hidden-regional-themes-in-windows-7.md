Windows 7 bases its default theme offerings off of which location you select during setup. Though there are multiple regional themes, only one of them is installed by default when you choose your location during setup. If you would like to install the other themes, here's how.

First, copy and paste this into the Start menu search box and press Enter:
```
C:\Windows\Globalization\MCT
```

A folder called MCT should open. In it, you will see five folders with country codes for Australia, Canada, Great Britain, the United States, and South Africa:
![Windows 7 MCT Folder](/assets/images/mct-folder.png)

In each folder, you will find a number of subfolders. The subfolder with the country name contains the images for that region's theme, and the subfolder called "Theme" contains the installable themepack for that region's theme. Double-click on the themepack to install it.

Any themes you choose to install will appear under the My Themes section of the Personalization window.
