title: "Starting Again"
---
It's been a little under two years now since I took this site offline and embarked on one of my longest breaks from publishing since I started blogging back in 2012.

Recently, I've been compelled to start again. Maybe it's the result of reading one too many AI-generated Medium articles, or maybe it's a reaction to my growing sense of dismay about the death of the Web I grew up with, a place where people wrote their own content and Google Search actually worked. Or, maybe I just feel indebted to people like [Chris Siebenmann](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/), [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), and all others whose content has helped me over the years.

In any case, here we are again, this time on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Let's see what happens next.
