## What is w00tw00t.at.blackhats.romanian.anti-sec?

Here's an interesting log excerpt from a pretty common bot scan that you'll likely see if you run your own web server for any length of time:
```
203.0.113.42 - - [21/Jun/2016:06:35:55 -0400] "GET /w00tw00t.at.blackhats.romanian.anti-sec:) HTTP/1.1" 400 0 "-" "ZmEu"
```

In this excerpt, we see that a client made a GET request for `/w00tw00t.at.blackhats.romanian.anti-sec:)`, a nonexistent resource. However, the server returned `400 Bad Request` instead of the expected response code, `404 Not Found`.

This is worth looking into because of the unexpected response code, but if your server is configured properly, this shouldn't be an issue.

## What This Means

The `w00tw00t` entries are created by the [ZmEu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZmEu_(vulnerability_scanner)) or DFind vulnerability scanners as part of an attempt at banner grabbing. Banner grabbing is an enumeration technique, and in this case the scanner was searching for information about my server that could reveal possible exploits.

The process looks something like this: A bot, possibly an infected computer or a proxy server, sends an `HTTP GET` request with a bogus URI in the hope that the targeted server will respond with some information about its configuration. In my case, Nginx determined that the HTTP request was malformed in some way, so it rejected it with a `400 Bad Request` status code. Most likely, the request was missing the `Host` header, in the hope that my server would fill it in or provide some other information.

The bottom line is that if you're running a web server, you're going to come across these requests in your server logs at some point. The Internet is frequently scanned by script kiddies looking for various vulnerabilities, but as long as your server returns a `400` error for any `w00tw00t` requests, you shouldn't have to worry. There are a few other variants of this scan as well, including one that makes a request for `/w00tw00t.at.ISC.SANS.DFind:)`.
